# ManOfTheMatch
Scenario: 

#The 'Man of the Match' award of a 50-over cricket match is decided by computing points earned by players. The points are calculated on the basis of the following rules: 

#Batting: 

  1 point for 2 runs scored 
  Additional 5 points for a half-century 
  Additional 10 points for a century 
  2 points for strike rate (runs/balls faced) of 80-100 
  Additional 4 points for strike rate>100 
  1 point for hitting a boundary (four) and 2 points for over boundary (six)
  
#Bowling: 

  10 points for each wicket 
  Additional 5 points for three wickets in innings 
  Additional 10 points for 5 wickets or more in innings 
  4 points for economy rate (runs given per over) between 3.5 and 4.5
  7 points for an economic rate between 2 and 3.5 
  10 points for an economy rate less than 2
  Fielding: 

#10 points each for catch/stumping/run out 
The performance of each player is stored in a dictionary object. Displayed below is data for 5 players. 




#Problem Statement: 

Assuming that these are the top 5 performers, write a Python program to decide the player with the highest points. Develop separate functions to compute batting and bowling points and save them in a module. These functions should be imported into the main code. 


#Assignment Submission: 

#Your submission should have a fully functional code with: 

One module containing the required functions. 
One script file with the main code which computes the top player amongst the 5 given players.
